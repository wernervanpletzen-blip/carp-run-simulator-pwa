      <h1>Privacy Policy – Carp Run Alarm Simulator</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 November 2025</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Carp Run Alarm Simulator (“the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses and protects information when you use the App.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>The App is designed as a simple fishing simulation game. We collect and store only limited information necessary to provide game features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Username:</strong> A nickname or angler name that you choose when creating your profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Avatar selection:</strong> The avatar icon you select in the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay statistics:</strong> Such as your biggest carp, biggest common, biggest mirror, and total weight caught, stored on your device.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not collect your real name, email address, phone number, physical address, or precise location.</p>

      <h2>2. How Information Is Stored</h2>
      <p>Your profile (username, avatar and stats) is stored locally on your device using local storage. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The data stays on your device unless you delete it (for example by clearing app data or browser storage).</li>
        <li>We do not personally identify you from this data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. World Leaderboard (Future Feature)</h2>
      <p>The App may be updated in the future to include an online/global leaderboard. If this feature is enabled, the App may send the following limited information to a secure backend service (for example, a database such as Firebase):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your chosen username</li>
        <li>Your avatar selection</li>
        <li>Your gameplay statistics (biggest carp, biggest common, biggest mirror and total weight caught)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information would only be used to display anonymous rankings and competition statistics inside the App. We will not sell your data or use it to track you across other apps or websites.</p>

      <h2>4. Analytics & Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>At this stage, the App does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or social media login.</p>
      <p>If this changes in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated and any new data usage will be clearly described.</p>

      <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is a simple fishing simulation and can be enjoyed by users of different ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has provided personal data that should be removed, please contact us so we can assist.</p>

      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect data handled by the App. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change your username and avatar directly in the App (by updating your profile, if this feature is available in the current version).</li>
        <li>Delete your local data by clearing the App’s data or clearing your browser storage.</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, the “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be changed. Continued use of the App after changes are made will constitute your acceptance of the revised Policy.</p>

      <h2>9. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your data is used, please contact the developer or publisher of Carp Run Alarm Simulator via the contact details provided in the app store listing or associated website.</p>

      <p>By using Carp Run Alarm Simulator, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
